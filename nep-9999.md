# DAO Contract Standard
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

> Thanks to the Astro team for all their hard work!

*This NEP is based on the open-source [Sputnik DAO contract](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/tree/main/sputnikdao2/src), developed and commonly used in the NEAR ecosystem. The ideas presented here come from ongoing collaborations with past contributors and current members of the DAO Builders Community Group.*

### Summary

A standard interface for any decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to support collective decision making with on-chain proposals, membership, and  governance systems.

This will provide a common set of functions and data structures that DAO contracts can use to implement core functionality. This will allow developers to quickly and easily build DAO contracts that are compatible with existing tooling. Also, the interoperabe standard would make DAOs more accesible for users across platforms in the NEAR ecosystem.

## Motivation

There is a need for a standard DAO contract interface to facilitate coordination and ensure interoperability across projects built on NEAR.

#### *What use cases does it support?*

1. real-time “My DAOs” tab next to “My NFTs” in a Near Social profile or wallet
2. interoperability across platforms with common data schema of `Project(s)`
3. cohesive + decentralized governance systems for communities, near and far!

#### *What is the expected outcome?*

This NEP is requesting review and comments by NEAR experts and other engineers involved with the Contract Standards Working Group. This feedback could help to derive a standard DAO contract that is compatible with the Sputnik DAO implementation.

Standardizing a DAO contract interface is important because it allows for interoperability between different DAOs, empowering all kinds of DAOs to interact with each other and exchange resources. This helps to create a more seamless and efficient ecosystem for DAOs built on NEAR, and the standard  could makes it easier for developers to create new DAOs that can seamlessly integrate with existing ones. dditionally, the open-source Sputnik DAO contract code may further evolve to support new governance modules, which enable greater diversity and inclusion for DAOs.

## Rationale & Alternatives

Standardizing a DAO contract interface is important because it allows for interoperability between different DAOs, making it easier for them to interact with each other and share resources. This helps to create a more seamless ecosystem for DAOs, and makes it easier for developers to create new DAOs that can integrate with existing DAOs.

The Sputnik DAO code has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by the community, and it was designed with scalability, security, and upgradability in mind. Additionally, the Sputnik DAO code is maintained by the community, ensuring that it will remain up-to-date with the latest best practices and standards for DAOs. Overall, the Sputnik DAO code provides a robust and flexible platform for standardizing DAO contract interfaces.

#### *Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?*

The Sputnik DAO contract code provides a solid foundation for a standard contract interface for DAOs on the NEAR blockchain.

Key Features:

* **actions**
* **proposals**
* **membership**
* **policies**
* **voting**
* upgradability
* bounties
* delegation

This modular contract design enables anyone to build clients / apps or integrations extending its capabilities.

#### *Which other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?*

Many designs from other ecosystems have been considered in developing this Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) standard.

Some of the DAO designs that have been proposed and discussed include:

* **Token-Weighted Voting:** This design uses tokens as the basis for voting power, where token holders can vote in proportion to the number of tokens they hold or stake.
* **Liquid Democracy:** This design allows for delegation of voting power, where individuals can choose to delegate their voting rights to a representative (usually with tokens).
* **Futarchy:** This design uses prediction markets to determine the outcome of voting, where individuals can bet on the outcome of a vote, and the outcome is determined based on the market result.
* **Quadratic Voting:** This design uses a quadratic function (can be cubic or another function) to distribute voting power across known accounts to balance power of large stakeholders.
* **Conviction Voting:** Th decision making process that funds proposals based on the aggregated preference of community members, expressed continuously.

Looking at the [DAOstar model](https://daostar.one/EIP-4824-Common-Interfaces-for-DAOs-c89409d239004f41bd06cb21852e1684) proposed by [MetaGov](https://metagov.org) for guidance around principles, although it is made for EVM-based DAOs.

Also, there have been discussions about digital identity verification for democratic aand reputation-weighted voting through Near Social.

**The goal here is to propose a DAO standard that doesn't overspecify the actual governance framework. It only needs to enable a core feature set, useful to all DAOs on NEAR.**

*Compare and contrast the Sputnik DAO contract code with other existing DAO contracts, highlighting its strengths and limitations:*

Sputnik DAO is the main DAO contract system on NEAR.

Other products worth considering: [Niche clubs](https://www.niche.club), [Popula communities](https://testnet.popula.io/communities), [Capsule](https://capsule.social), and more (feel free to add here).

### Vostok
This [alternative DAO contract](https://github.com/robert-zaremba/vostok-dao/blob/master/docs/guide-v1.md) was proposed by @robert-zaremba, and it creates a multi-sig NEAR wallet. This represents a simpler approach (fixed voters + NEAR transfers), which might be useful to standardize as well.

Parameters:
* `members`: list of signers (voters) for this multisig wallet.
* `min_support`: minimum support a proposal have to get (in power votes) to pass.
* `min_duration`: minimum voting time (in number of seconds) for a new proposal.
* `max_duration`: maximum voting time (in number of seconds) for a new proposal.
* `min_bond`: minimum deposit a caller have to put to create a new proposal. It includes the storage fees.
       
For more complex functionality, something like Sputnik DAO is necessary. The major differences are flexiblility and modularity, along with group membership structures and role-based governance policies / permissions.

Both Sputnik and Vostok rely on the concept of a general `action` which is done as a result of an approved `proposal`. Reconfiguration is a crucial ability for people to evolve DAOs together, and granular permissions help make things realistic for operators.

* `Proposal` consists of a proposer account, a description, an `ActionInt` (which specifies the action to be taken), a set of voters, a voting_start and voting_end timestamp (when voting is active), the number of votes_for and votes_against, an execute_before timestamp, and a flag executed that is set to true if the proposal was executed.
* `Voter` struct holds an account ID and a voting power, and the `ActionInt` and `Action` enum represent the action to be taken, either a `Transfer` of some amount of tokens to a destination account, or a `Delete` of the destination account.
* `to_aint` method converts an `Action` object to an `ActionInt` and the `Into` implementation does the reverse.
* The `vote` method updates the proposal with a vote from a voter and the `execute` method executes the action if the proposal has passed a minimum support threshold.

Vostok proposals are a good example of a simpler model that we are considering. One major differentiator of Sputnik is `policy.rs`.

> This module contains several structures for representing policies and roles within a Sputnik DAO, such as the `RoleKind`, `RolePermission`, `UserInfo`, `VotePolicy`, and `Policy` structures. The code implements methods for adding, updating, and removing roles within a policy, as well as updating the default vote policy.

#### *What is the impact of not doing this?*

DAOs are reaching the extent of their original design limitations. There might need to be a system for composability to allow innovative features or apps to interact in ways not possible today.

Potential benefits of standardizing the DAO contract interface:

* ecosystem-wide interoperability
* better alignment across projects
* easier adoption by new builders

Not coordinating and collaborating to develop this DAO contract standard may result in confusion and technical debt as NEAR shifts away from the Astro platform toward Near Social.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

This contract is a Rust code that defines functions and types for a governance system, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), powered by the NEAR blockchain platform. Below is a detailed description of the structures and functions in the Sputnik DAO contract system. Overall, the structure represents current state of a DAO. For example, the list of members and their voting power, as well as tokens in the DAO account.

### [lib.rs](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/blob/main/sputnikdao2/src/lib.rs) (main DAO contract)

Main module of the DAO, which acts as the entry point for the contract system. Here is where to import and use the functionality defined in other modules, e.g., `policy.rs`, `proposals.rs` and `types.rs`. It also defines the *public interface* of the contract, including methods that can be called by external clients to interact with the DAO.

Responsibilities of `lib.rs` include handling incoming transactions, state transitions, and updating the contract's storage. This module interacts with the storage and functions defined in other modules to implement the core functionality of the DAO:

--> creating and managing **proposals**, **policies** and **members**, along with processing **votes** and **updating the state** of the DAO as a whole

The code includes several storage keys, including `Policy`, `Proposals` and `Config`.

The `Contract` struct stores configuration, policy, proposals, delegations and bounties (excluded from the standard for now), and more. Several methods are provided to interact with the DAO:

* `new(config: Config, policy: VersionedPolicy)`: initializes a new instance of the contract.
* `get_config() -> PromiseOrValue<Config>`: returns the current configuration of the DAO.
* `get_policy() -> PromiseOrValue<VersionedPolicy>`: returns the current voting and permissions policy.
* `get_proposal_ids() -> PromiseOrValue<Vec<u64>>`: returns the list of proposal IDs in the DAO.
* `get_proposal(proposal_id: u64) -> PromiseOrValue<ProposalOutput>`: returns the information of a proposal with the given ID.
* `create_proposal(proposal: ProposalInput) -> PromiseOrValue<u64>`: creates a new proposal in the DAO.
* `vote(proposal_id: u64, vote: bool) -> PromiseOrValue<()>`: votes on a proposal with the given ID.
* `execute_proposal(proposal_id: u64) -> PromiseOrValue<()>`: executes a proposal with the given ID.

Several data structures are provided by the `near_sdk::collections` module, such as `LazyOption`, `LookupMap`, and `Vec`, to store the DAO state. The state is stored using Borsh serialization and the `BorshStorageKey` trait is used to define the storage keys for the state.

**This module also has an implementation of an interface called `ExtSelf` that allows for callbacks after proposal execution.**

Below is an abbreviated version of the code:


```rust
mod policy;
mod proposals;
mod types;

pub enum StorageKeys {
   Config,
   Policy,
   Proposals,
}

pub struct Contract {
   pub config: LazyOption<Config>,
   pub policy: LazyOption<VersionedPolicy>,
   pub last_proposal_id: u64,
   pub proposals: LookupMap<u64, VersionedProposal>,
}

/// After payouts, allows a callback
#[ext_contract(ext_self)]
pub trait ExtSelf {
   /// Callback after proposal execution.
fn on_proposal_callback(&mut self, proposal_id: u64) -> PromiseOrValue<()>;
}


```
### [policy.rs](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/blob/main/sputnikdao2/src/policy.rs)

This module supports voting and permissioning. It defines a struct named `Policy` that stores information about a specific policy within the DAO, such as the policy text and the current state of the policy (active or inactive). It also defines a `Policies` struct that serves as a collection of policies and includes methods for adding, updating, and retrieving policies.

Plus, the module contains functions for handling incoming transactions related to policies, such as creating a new policy, voting on a policy, and processing the results of a vote.

The code defines structs `RolePermission`, `UserInfo`, and `VotePolicy` for managing the roles, users, and voting policies in the system, respectively. The `RolePermission` struct represents a role with a name, a kind that can be everyone, a member with a certain balance, or a group of accounts, a set of permissions, and a vote policy with a weight kind (token weight or role weight), quorum, and threshold.

The `UserInfo` struct represents a user with an account ID and a balance. The `VotePolicy` struct represents a voting policy with a weight kind, quorum, and threshold. The threshold can be either a weight or a ratio, and can be converted to a weight based on the total weight. The code also defines enums `RoleKind`, `WeightOrRatio`, and `WeightKind` for defining different types of roles, weights or ratios, and weight kinds, respectively.

In summary, `policy.rs` enables the core functionality of managing policies within a DAO. It is responsible for transactions involving policies, updating  state of policies, and providing information about policies to other parts of the system.

Below is an abbreviated version of the code:

```rust
pub enum RoleKind {
   Everyone,
   Member(U128),
   Group(HashSet<AccountId>),
}

impl RoleKind {
    pub fn match_user(&self, user: &UserInfo) -> bool {}
    pub fn get_role_size(&self) -> Option<usize> {}
    pub fn add_member_to_group(&mut self, member_id: &AccountId) -> Result<(), ()> {}
    pub fn remove_member_from_group(&mut self, member_id: &AccountId) -> Result<(), ()> {}
}

pub struct RolePermission {
   pub name: String,
   pub kind: RoleKind,
   /// <proposal_kind>:<action>
   pub permissions:
	HashSet<String>,
   pub vote_policy:

}

pub struct UserInfo {

            threshold: WeightOrRatio::Ratio(1, 2),
        }
    }

        name: &String
    ) -> Option<&RolePermission> { ... }
    pub fn proposal_status(
        &self, 
        proposal: &Proposal, 
        roles: Vec<String>, 
        total_supply: Balance,
    ) -> ProposalStatus { ... }
}

```
### [proposals.rs](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/blob/main/sputnikdao2/src/proposals.rs)

This module defines a struct named `Proposal` that stores information about a proposed action, including the proposer, the proposal text, and the current state of the proposal (pending, accepted, or rejected). Also, it defines a `Proposals` struct that serves as a collection of proposals and includes methods for adding, updating, and retrieving proposals.

Additionally, it contains functions for handling incoming transactions related to proposals, such as creating a new proposal, voting on a proposal, and processing the results of a vote.

In summary, `proposals.rs` enables the core functionality for managing proposals within a DAO. It is responsible for transactions involving proposals, updating the state of proposals, and providing information about proposals to other parts of the system.

Types:

* `ProposalStatus`: An enumeration that defines the status of a proposal.
* `ActionCall`: A struct that describes a method call along with its arguments, deposit, and gas.
* `PolicyParameters`: A struct that holds values for proposal bond, proposal period, bounty bond, and bounty forgiveness period.
* `ProposalKind`: An enumeration that defines different kinds of proposals, including:
  * Changing the configuration
  * Upgrading the system
  * Transferring tokens
  * Adding a bounty
* `Vote`: An enumeration that defines three possible voting actions: Approve, Reject, and Remove.
* `Proposal`: A struct that holds information about a proposal such as proposer, description, kind, status, vote counts, votes, and submission time.
* `ProposalInput`: A struct that holds information needed to create a proposal such as description and kind.

Functions are defined to update votes on a proposal and convert `ProposalInput` to `Proposal`.

Below is an abbreviated version of the code:

```rust
pub enum ProposalStatus {
    InProgress,
    Approved,
    Rejected,

### [types.rs](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/blob/main/sputnikdao2/src/types.rs)

* `AccountId`: account identifier on the NEAR platform
* `Balance`: balance of a particular account or amount of tokens in a DAO
* `ProposalIndex`: index of a proposal within the DAO
* `VotingPower`: voting power of a member within the DAO

`Action` enum is defined with a method `to_policy_label()` that returns a string representation of the variant.

Below is an abbreviated version of the code:

```rust
pub struct Config {
   pub name: String,
   pub purpose: String,
   pub metadata: Base64VecU8,
}

pub enum Action {
   AddProposal,
   RemoveProposal,
   VoteApprove,
   VoteReject,
   VoteRemove,
   Finalize,
   MoveToHub,
}

impl Action {
    pub fn to_policy_label(&self) -> String {
        format!("{:?}", self)
    }
}

```


## Reference Implementation

The Sputnik DAO contract code is available on GitHub:
https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract

User interfaces built on the Sputnik DAO contracts (oldest to newest):

1. https://old.sputnik.fund --> V1 contracts
2. https://sputnik.fund --> V1 contracts
3. https://v2.sputnik.fund --> v2 contracts
4. https://app.astrodao.com --> v2 contracts

*< explain how Astro users deploy and interact with Sputnik DAO contracts >*

### Sputnik DAO Contract System (V2)

Factory:

* [sputnikdao-factory2/src](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/tree/main/sputnikdao-factory2) (code)
* [sputnik-dao.near](https://nearblocks.io/address/sputnik-dao.near) (mainnet)
* [sputnikv2.testnet](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/sputnikv2.testnet) (testnet)

DAOs:

* [sputnikdao2/src](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/tree/main/sputnikdao2) (code)
* <dao_name>.sputnik-dao.near (mainnet)
* <dao_name>.sputnikv2.testnet (testnet)

See all DAOs by calling:

`near view sputnik-dao.near get_dao_list` (mainnet)

`near view sputnikv2.testnet get_dao_list` (testnet)

Details on [V3 Sputnik DAO](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/releases/tag/3.0.0) ([changelog](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/compare/2.0.0...3.0.0))

## Future Possibilities
> Credit goes to Trevor of CronCat for these ideas, which inspired this proposal!

The natural extension and evolution of this proposal would be improving the Sputnik DAO contract system to be more accessible, meaningful and useful. Ultimately, this may help drive adoption of such valuable, open-source technology for builders. **Sputnik enables anyone to build clients or integrations extending its capabilities.**

#### [POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/wiki/%5BDRAFT%5D-DAO-Data-Model-Architectures)

### Considerations:
* Multi-chain Interoperability with [DAOstar One](https://daostar.one/EIP)
* [Near Social](https://near.social): Open Web DAO Components
* [DAO Composability](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/wiki/DAO-Composability) / [Governance Modules](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/wiki/Module-Composability-UX)
