```

## Summary

A standard interface that supports decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that enable proposals with governance and voters.

## Motivation

This NEP is a response to the need for interoperability throughout DAO systems built on NEAR and other blockchains.

## Rationale

> [EIP-4824](https://daostar.one/EIP), courtesy of Metagov (Joshua Tan, Isaac Patka, Ido Gershtein, Eyal Eithcowich, Michael Zargham, and Sam Furter)

Let's assume that all DAOs possess at least two primitives:

1. **Membership** is defined by a set of addresses.
2. **Behavior** is defined by a set of possible contract actions, including calls to external contracts and calls to internal functions.

**Proposals** relate membership and behavior; they are *objects* which which members can interact. If and when executed, they become actions of the DAO (via governance).

## Specification 

> The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

`Contract` storage includes `Policy` (members + roles), `Proposals` (actions + votes), and `Config` (types).

Several methods are provided to interact with the DAO:

### [Application Binary Interface](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/blob/main/sputnikdao2/ABI.md)

```
{
  "viewMethods": [
    "get_config",
    "get_policy",
    "get_last_proposal_id",
    "get_proposals",
    "get_proposal",
  ],
  "changeMethods": [
    "new",
    "add_proposal",
    "act_proposal",
  ],
}
```

CORE DAO FUNCTIONALITY

--> creating and managing **proposals**, **policies** and **members**, along with processing **votes** and **updating the state** of the DAO as a whole

### DAO Interface

```ts
/// For decentralized autonomous organizations.

type DAO = {
  config: Config,
  policy: Policy,
}

/******************/
/* CHANGE METHODS */
/******************/

/// add_proposal: submit a proposal to the DAO
///
/// Requirements
/// * Caller of the method must attach a deposit of 1 yoctoⓃ for security purposes.
/// * Calling the method fails in case of insufficient deposit.
/// * Only those with permission can add the proposal.
/// * The proposal is added to a list of proposals.
///
/// Arguments:
/// * `description`: context of the proposal
/// * `kind`: type of the proposal

function add_proposal(
    proposal: {
        description: String,
        kind: ProposalKind,
    },
): u64;

/// act_proposal: act on given proposal by id, if permissions allow
///
/// A successful workflow will end in a success execution outcome
/// to the callback on the DAO contract at the method `on_proposal_callback`.
///
/// Requirements:
/// * Caller of the method must attach a deposit of 1 yoctoⓃ for security purposes.
/// * Only those with permission can act on the the proposal.
///
/// Arguments:
/// * `id`: the ID of the proposal.
/// * `action`: the action with the proposal.

function act_proposal(
    id: u64,
    action: Action,
)

```
