# DAO Contract Standard

*This NEP is based on the open-source [Sputnik DAO contract](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/tree/main/sputnikdao2/src), developed and commonly used in the NEAR ecosystem. The ideas presented here come from ongoing collaborations with past contributors and various active members of the DAO Builders Community Group.*

### Summary

A standard interface for any decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to support collective decision making with on-chain proposals, membership, and  governance features.

This will provide a common set of functions and data structures that DAO contracts can use to implement their governance and decision making functionality. This will allow developers to build DAO contracts that are compatible with existing tooling. Also, would make it easier for users to participate in and understand DAOs in the NEAR ecosystem.

## Motivation

#### *What use cases does it support?*

1. real-time “My DAOs” tab next to “My NFTs” in a Near Social profile or wallet
2. interoperability across platforms with common data schema of `Project(s)`
3. cohesive + decentralized governance systems for communities, near and far!

#### *What is the expected outcome?*

This development could spark new DAO factory implementations by projects integrating with Near Social. There is a need for a standard interface to facilitate coordination and ensure interoperability across the organizations built on NEAR.

Standardizing a DAO contract interface is important because it allows for interoperability between different DAOs, making it easier for them to interact with each other and share resources. This helps to create a more seamless and efficient ecosystem for DAOs, and makes it easier for developers to create new DAOs that can integrate with existing ones.

The Sputnik DAO code is well suited for this purpose because it provides a standard, open-source contract interface that can be used by multiple DAOs. This code has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by the community, and it has been designed with scalability, security, and compatibility in mind. Additionally, the Sputnik DAO code is maintained and updated by the community, ensuring that it remains up-to-date with the latest best practices and standards for DAOs. Overall, the Sputnik DAO code provides a robust and flexible platform for standardizing DAO contract interfaces.

Additionally, the open-source Sputnik DAO contract code may further evolve to support new governance modules, which enable greater diversity and inclusion for DAOs.

This NEP is requesting review and comments by NEAR experts and other engineers involved with the Contract Standards Working Group.

## Rationale & Alternatives

Standardizing a DAO contract interface is important because it allows for interoperability between different DAOs, making it easier for them to interact with each other and share resources. This helps to create a more seamless ecosystem for DAOs, and makes it easier for developers to create new DAOs that can integrate with existing DAOs.

The Sputnik DAO code has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by the community, and it was designed with scalability, security, and upgradability in mind. Additionally, the Sputnik DAO code is maintained by the community, ensuring that it will remain up-to-date with the latest best practices and standards for DAOs. Overall, the Sputnik DAO code provides a robust and flexible platform for standardizing DAO contract interfaces.

#### *Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?*

The Sputnik DAO contract code provides a solid foundation for a standard contract interface for DAOs on the NEAR blockchain.

Key Features:

* **actions**
* **proposals**
* **membership**
* **policies**
* **voting**
* upgradability
* bounties
* delegation

This modular contract design enables anyone to build clients / apps or integrations extending its capabilities.

#### *Which other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?*

Many designs from other ecosystems have been considered in developing this Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) standard.

Some of the DAO designs that have been proposed and discussed include:

* Token-Weighted Voting: This design uses tokens as the basis for voting power, where token holders can vote in proportion to the number of tokens they hold or stake.
* Liquid Democracy: This design allows for delegation of voting power, where individuals can choose to delegate their voting rights to a representative (usually with tokens).
* Futarchy: This design uses prediction markets to determine the outcome of voting, where individuals can bet on the outcome of a vote, and the outcome is determined based on the market result.
* Quadratic Voting: This design uses a quadratic function (can be cubic or another function) to distribute voting power across known accounts to balance power of large stakeholders.
* Conviction Voting: Th decision making process that funds proposals based on the aggregated preference of community members, expressed continuously.

Looking at the [DAOstar model](https://daostar.one/EIP-4824-Common-Interfaces-for-DAOs-c89409d239004f41bd06cb21852e1684) proposed by [MetaGov](https://metagov.org) for guidance around principles, although it is made for EVM-based DAOs.

Also, there have been discussions about digital identity verification for democratic aand reputation-weighted voting through Near Social.

The goal here is to propose a DAO standard that doesn't overspecify the governance framework. It only needs to enable a core feature set, useful to all DAOs on NEAR.

*Compare and contrast the Sputnik DAO contract code with other existing DAO contracts, highlighting its strengths and limitations:*

Sputnik DAO is the main DAO contract system on NEAR.

Other products worth considering: [Niche clubs](https://www.niche.club), [Popula communities](https://testnet.popula.io/communities), [Capsule](https://capsule.social), and more (feel free to add here).

This [alternative DAO contract](https://github.com/robert-zaremba/vostok-dao/blob/master/docs/guide-v1.md) was proposed by @robert-zaremba, and it creates a multi-sig NEAR wallet. This represents a simpler approach (fixed voters + NEAR transfers), which might be useful to standardize as well.

Parameters:
    + `members`: list of signers (voters) for this multisig wallet.
    + `min_support`: minimum support a proposal have to get (in power votes) to pass.
    + `min_duration`: minimum voting time (in number of seconds) for a new proposal.
    + `max_duration`: maximum voting time (in number of seconds) for a new proposal.
    + `min_bond`: minimum deposit a caller have to put to create a new proposal. It includes the storage fees.
       
For more complex functionality, Sputnik DAO is necessary. The major differences are flexiblility and modularity, along with group membership structures and role-based governance policies / permissions.

}

```

Both Sputnik and Vostok rely on the concept of a general `action` which is done as a result of an approved `proposal`. Reconfiguration is a crucial ability for people to evolve DAOs together, and granular permissions help make things realistic for operators.

#### *What is the impact of not doing this?*

DAOs are reaching the extent of their original design limitations. There might need to be a system for composability to allow innovative features or apps to interact in ways not possible today.

Potential benefits of standardizing the DAO contract interface:

* ecosystem-wide interoperability
* better alignment across projects
* easier adoption by new builders

Not coordinating to develop this DAO contract standard may result in confusion and technical debt as NEAR shifts away from the Astro platform toward Near Social.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

This contract is a Rust implementation for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), meant to be used on the NEAR blockchain platform. Below is a detailed description of the structures and functions in the Sputnik DAO contract system, along with discussion of tradeoffs, limitations, and challenges. Overall, the structure represents current DAO state. For example, the list of members and their voting power, as well as tokens the DAO has collected.

### [lib.rs](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/blob/main/sputnikdao2/src/lib.rs) (main DAO contract)

Main module of the DAO, which acts as the entry point for the contract system. Here is where to import and use the functionality defined in other modules, e.g., `proposals.rs`, `types.rs`, and `policy.rs`. It also defines the *public interface* of the contract, including methods that can be called by external clients to interact with the DAO.

Responsibilities of `lib.rs` include handling incoming transactions, state transitions, and updating the contract's storage. This module interacts with the storage and functions defined in other modules to implement the core functionality of the DAO:

> creating and managing **proposals**, **policies** and **members**, along with processing **votes** and **updating the state** of the DAO as a whole.

The `Contract` struct stores configuration, policy, delegations, proposals, bounties, and more. Several methods are provided to interact with the DAO:

* **creating proposals**
* claiming bounties
* delegating tokens

This module also has an implementation of an interface called `ExtSelf` that allows for callbacks after proposal execution.

Below is an abbreviated version of the code:


```rust
Which modules to include?

mod bounties;
mod delegation;
mod policy;
mod proposals;
mod types;
mod upgrade;

pub enum StorageKeys {
   Config,
   Policy,
   Delegations,
   Proposals,
   Bounties,
   BountyClaimers,
   BountyClaimCounts,
   Blobs,
}

pub struct Contract {
   pub config: LazyOption<Config>,
   pub policy: LazyOption<VersionedPolicy>,
   pub locked_amount: Balance,
   pub staking_id: Option<AccountId>,
   pub total_delegation_amount: Balance,
   pub delegations: LookupMap<AccountId, Balance>,
   pub last_proposal_id: u64,
   pub proposals: LookupMap<u64, VersionedProposal>,
   pub last_bounty_id: u64,
   pub bounties: LookupMap<u64, VersionedBounty>,
   pub bounty_claimers: LookupMap<AccountId, Vec<BountyClaim>>,
   pub bounty_claims_count: LookupMap<u64, u32>,
   pub blobs: LookupMap<CryptoHash, AccountId>,
}

/// After payouts, allows a callback
#[ext_contract(ext_self)]
pub trait ExtSelf {
   /// Callback after proposal execution.
fn on_proposal_callback(&mut self, proposal_id: u64) -> PromiseOrValue<()>;
}


```
### [policy.rs](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/blob/main/sputnikdao2/src/policy.rs)

This module defines a struct named `Policy` that stores information about a specific policy within the DAO, such as the policy text and the current state of the policy (active or inactive). It also defines a `Policies` struct that serves as a collection of policies and includes methods for adding, updating, and retrieving policies.

Plus, the module contains functions for handling incoming transactions related to policies, such as creating a new policy, voting on a policy, and processing the results of a vote.

In summary, `policy.rs` enables the core functionality of managing policies within a DAO. It is responsible for transactions involving policies, updating  state of policies, and providing information about policies to other parts of the system.

Below is an abbreviated version of the code:

```rust
pub enum RoleKind {
   Everyone,
   Member(U128),
   Group(HashSet<AccountId>),
}

impl RoleKind {
    pub fn match_user(&self, user: &UserInfo) -> bool {}
    pub fn get_role_size(&self) -> Option<usize> {}
    pub fn add_member_to_group(&mut self, member_id: &AccountId) -> Result<(), ()> {}
    pub fn remove_member_from_group(&mut self, member_id: &AccountId) -> Result<(), ()> {}
}

pub struct RolePermission {
   pub name: String,
   pub kind: RoleKind,
   /// <proposal_kind>:<action>
   pub permissions:

            quorum: U128(0),
            threshold: WeightOrRatio::Ratio(1, 2),
        }
    }
}

    ) -> (Vec<String>, bool) { ... }
    pub fn is_token_weighted(

        proposal_kind_label: &String
    ) -> bool { ... }
    fn internal_get_role(
        &self, 
        name: &String
    ) -> Option<&RolePermission> { ... }
    pub fn proposal_status(
        &self, 
        proposal: &Proposal, 
        roles: Vec<String>, 
        total_supply: Balance,
    ) -> ProposalStatus { ... }
}

```
### [proposals.rs](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/blob/main/sputnikdao2/src/proposals.rs)

This module defines a struct named `Proposal` that stores information about a proposed action, including the proposer, the proposal text, and the current state of the proposal (pending, accepted, or rejected). Also, it defines a `Proposals` struct that serves as a collection of proposals and includes methods for adding, updating, and retrieving proposals.

Additionally, it contains functions for handling incoming transactions related to proposals, such as creating a new proposal, voting on a proposal, and processing the results of a vote.

In summary, `proposals.rs` enables the core functionality for managing proposals within a DAO. It is responsible for transactions involving proposals, updating the state of proposals, and providing information about proposals to other parts of the system.

### [types.rs](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/blob/main/sputnikdao2/src/types.rs)


This module provides a centralized location for defining custom types used throughout the code, making it more readable, maintainable, and flexible.

`types.rs` includes the following:

* `AccountId`: account identifier on the NEAR platform
* `Balance`: balance of a particular account or amount of tokens in a DAO
* `ProposalIndex`: index of a proposal within the DAO
* `VotingPower`: voting power of a member within the DAO

Defining these types in a separate module gives a clear separation between custom types and implementation of the DAO logic. This makes it easier to understand how different parts of the code relate to each other, and it is easier to change the code, if necessary.

Below is an abbreviated version of the code:

```rust
pub struct Config {
   pub name: String,
   pub purpose: String,
   pub metadata: Base64VecU8,
}

pub enum Action {
   AddProposal,
   RemoveProposal,
   VoteApprove,
   VoteReject,
   VoteRemove,
   Finalize,
   MoveToHub,
}

impl Action {
    pub fn to_policy_label(&self) -> String {
        format!("{:?}", self)
    }
}

```


## Reference Implementation

The Sputnik DAO contract code is available on GitHub:
https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract

User interfaces built on the Sputnik DAO contracts (oldest to newest):

1. https://old.sputnik.fund --> V1 contracts
2. https://sputnik.fund --> V1 contracts
3. https://v2.sputnik.fund --> v2 contracts
4. https://app.astrodao.com --> v2 contracts

*< explain how Astro users deploy and interact with Sputnik DAO contracts >*

Details on [V3 Sputnik DAO](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/releases/tag/3.0.0) ([changelog](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/compare/2.0.0...3.0.0))

## Future Possibilities
> Thanks to Trevor of CronCat for sharing these ideas and inspiring this proposal!

The natural extension and evolution of this proposal would be improving the Sputnik DAO contract system to be more accessible, meaningful and useful. Ultimately, this may help drive adoption of such valuable, open-source technology for builders. **Sputnik enables anyone to build clients or integrations extending its capabilities.**

#### [POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/wiki/%5BDRAFT%5D-DAO-Data-Model-Architectures)

### Considerations:
* Multi-chain Interoperability with [DAOstar One](https://daostar.one/EIP)
* [Near Social](https://near.social): Open Web DAO Components
* [DAO Composability](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/wiki/DAO-Composability) / [Governance Modules](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/wiki/Module-Composability-UX)
